# Landing-Page

This GitHub repository represents a project made for the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree course (Project 2). In this project, we were assigned to create a single webpage with a variety of different features, using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The content of the webpage is "Lorem Ipsum", or in other words, no meaningful content. The project was also partially created from the boilerplate code given by the course. Hope you like it!
